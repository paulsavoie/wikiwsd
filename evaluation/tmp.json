Nevertheless the young Hitchcock signed up to a cadet regiment of the Royal Engineers in 1917. His military stint was very limited: he received theoretical briefings, weekend drills and exercises. Hitchcock would march around [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and was required to wear [[puttees]], which he could never master how to wrap around his legs properly.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alfred Hitchcock|title= A life in Darkness|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>  \n\nIt was while working at Henley's that he first started to dabble creatively. Upon the formation of the company's in-house publication, ''The Henley Telegraph'', in 1919, Hitchcock started to submit short articles, eventually becoming one of its most prolific contributors. His first piece was \"Gas\" (1919), published in the very first issue, in which a young woman imagines that she is being assaulted one night in Paris \u2013 only for the [[Plot twist|twist]] to reveal that it was all just a hallucination in the dentist's chair, induced by the [[Anesthetic|anaesthetic]].

The short story \"And There Was No Rainbow\" (1920) was Hitchcock's first brush with possibly censurable material. A young man goes out looking for a brothel, only to stumble into the house of his best friend's girl. \"What's Who?\" (1920), while being very funny, was also a precursor to the famous [[Abbott and Costello]] \"[[Who's on First?]]\" routine. \"The History of Pea Eating\" (1920) was a [[Satire|satirical]] [[disquisition]] on the various attempts mankind has made over the centuries to eat peas successfully. His final piece, \"Fedora\" (1921), was his shortest and most enigmatic contribution.

Hitchcock told French director [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]:\n\n<blockquote>There are two men sitting in a train going to Scotland and one man says to the other, \"Excuse me, sir, but what is that strange parcel you have on the luggage rack above you?\", \"Oh\", says the other, \"that's a Macguffin.\", \"Well\", says the first man, \"what's a Macguffin?\", The other answers, \"It's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands.\", \"But\", says the first man, \"there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands.\", \"Well\", says the other, \"then that's no Macguffin.\"<ref>Patrick McGilligan, p. 158</ref></blockquote>\n\nHitchcock's next major success was his 1938 film ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', a fast-paced film about the search for a kindly old Englishwoman Miss Froy ([[Dame May Whitty]]), who disappears while on board a train in the fictional country of Bandrika.<ref name=\"Bandrika\">{{cite web| title=Lions of British Cinema-Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, (13&nbsp;August&nbsp;1899 \u2013 29 April 1980) | publisher=AvantGardeNow.com | url=http://www.avantgardenow.com/hitchcock.html| accessdate=6 March 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009021633/http://www.avantgardenow.com/hitchcock.html  |archivedate = 9 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nBy 1938, Hitchcock had become known for his alleged observation, \"Actors are cattle\". He once said that he first made this remark as early as the late 1920s, in connection to stage actors who were snobbish about motion pictures. However, [[Michael Redgrave]] said that Hitchcock had made the statement during the filming of ''The Lady Vanishes''. The phrase would haunt Hitchcock for years to come and would result in an incident during the filming of his 1941 production of ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'', where [[Carole Lombard]] brought some heifers onto the set with name tags of Lombard, [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], and [[Gene Raymond]], the stars of the film, to surprise the director. Hitchcock said he was misquoted: \"I said 'Actors should be ''treated'' like cattle'.\"<ref>Patrick McGilligan, pp. 210\u2013211, 277; American Movie Classics</ref>\n\nLauded in Britain where he was dubbed \"Alfred the Great\" by ''[[Picturegoer]]'' magazine, by the end of the 1930s Hitchcock's reputation was beginning to soar overseas, with a ''New York Times'' feature writer stating; \"Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not. Magna Carta, the Tower Bridge and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world.\"<ref>Leff, 1999. p. 16</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine referred to him as, \"probably the best native director in England.\"<ref>Leff, 1999. p. 21.</ref> [[David O. Selznick]] signed Hitchcock to a seven-year contract beginning in March 1939, and the Hitchcocks moved to Hollywood.<ref>Leff, 1999. p. 35.</ref>\n\n==Hollywood==\nIn Hollywood, the suspense and the [[gallows humour]] that had become Hitchcock's trademark in film continued to appear in his productions. The working arrangements with Selznick were less than optimal. Selznick suffered from perennial money problems, and Hitchcock was often displeased with Selznick's creative control over his films. In a later interview, Hitchcock summarised the working relationship thus:\n\n[[File:Anton Wickremasinghe, Chandran Rutnam and Alfred Hitchcock at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles.jpeg|thumb||Alfred Hitchcock with [[Chandran Rutnam]] (Center) and Sri Lankan Film Maker Anton Wickremasinghe at the [[Academy Awards]] in Los Angeles.]]\n<blockquote>[Selznick] was the Big Producer. [ . . . ] Producer was king, The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about me\u2014and it shows you the amount of control\u2014he said I was the \"only director\" he'd \"trust with a film\".<ref>Sidney Gottlieb, Alfred Hitchcock: Interviews By Alfred Hitchcock. Illustrated Edition. (Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2003). p. 206.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSelznick loaned Hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing Hitchcock's films himself. In addition, Selznick, as well as fellow independent producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]], made only a few films each year, so he did not always have projects for Hitchcock to direct. Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. Hitchcock was quickly impressed with the superior resources of the American studios compared to the financial restrictions he had frequently encountered in England.<ref>Leff, 1999. p. 30.</ref>\n\nWith the prestigious Selznick picture ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' in 1940, Hitchcock made his first American movie, set in a Hollywood version of England and based on a novel by English author [[Daphne du Maurier]]. The film starred [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Joan Fontaine]]. This [[Gothic novel|Gothic]] [[melodrama]] explores the fears of a na\u00efve young bride who enters a forbidding English country mansion and struggles to adapt to the severe formality and emotional coldness she finds there. The film won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] of 1940.<ref name=\"Rebecca\">{{cite web| title=Awards for ''Rebecca'' (1940) | publisher=Internet Movie Database| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032976/awards| accessdate=7 March 2008}}</ref> The statuette was given to Selznick, as the film's producer.<ref name=\"Rebecca\"/> The film did not win the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] award for Hitchcock.\n\nThere were additional problems between Selznick and Hitchcock, with Selznick known to impose very restrictive rules upon Hitchcock. At the same time, Selznick complained about Hitchcock's \"goddamn jigsaw cutting\", which meant that the producer did not have nearly the leeway to create his own film as he liked, but had to follow Hitchcock's vision of the finished product.<ref>Patrick McGilligan, pp. 251\u2013252</ref> ''Rebecca'' was the fourth longest of Hitchcock's films, at 130&nbsp;minutes, exceeded only by ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (132&nbsp;minutes), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (136&nbsp;minutes), and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' (142&nbsp;minutes).<ref>Patrick McGilligan, p. 253</ref>\n\nHitchcock's second American film, the European-set thriller ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), based on [[Vincent Sheean]]'s ''Personal History'' and produced by [[Walter Wanger]], was nominated for Best Picture that year. Hitchcock and other British subjects felt uneasy living and working in Hollywood while their country was at war; his concern resulted in the making of a film that overtly supported the British war effort.<ref>Duncan, Paul (2003). Alfred Hitchcock: architect of anxiety, 1899-1980. p.90. Taschen, 1 November 2003</ref> The movie was filmed in the first year of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and was inspired by the rapidly changing events in Europe, as fictionally covered by an American newspaper reporter portrayed by [[Joel McCrea]]. The film mixed actual footage of European scenes and scenes filmed on a Hollywood back lot. In compliance with Hollywood's Production Code censorship, the film avoided direct references to Nazism, Germany and Germans.<ref>Patrick McGilligan, p. 244</ref>\n\n===1940s films===\n[[File:Ingrid Bergman in Notorious Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cary Grant]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946)]]\nHitchcock's films during the 1940s were diverse, ranging from the romantic comedy ''Mr. & Mrs. Smith'' (1941) to the courtroom drama ''The Paradine Case'' (1947) to the dark and disturbing [[film noir]] ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943).\n\nIn September 1940, the Hitchcocks purchased the {{convert|200|acre|km2|sing=on}} Cornwall Ranch, located near [[Scotts Valley]] in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. The ranch became the primary residence of the Hitchcocks for the rest of their lives, although they kept their Bel Air home. ''[[Suspicion (film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941) marked Hitchcock's first film as a producer as well as director. The film was set in England, and Hitchcock used the north coast of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], California, for the English coastline sequence.<ref name=\"SantaCruzInspiration\" /> This film was to be actor [[Cary Grant]]'s first time working with Hitchcock, and it was one of the few times that Grant would be cast in a sinister role.<ref name=\"SantaCruzInspiration\" /> Joan Fontaine<ref>{{cite web |title= Joan Fontaine |publisher=Hollywood.com |url= http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Joan_Fontaine/197679 |accessdate=5 March 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080325023619/http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Joan_Fontaine/197679| archivedate= 25 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> won Best Actress [[Academy Award|Oscar]]<ref name=\"SantaCruzInspiration\" /> and the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]]<ref>{{cite web | title=New York Film Critics Circle Winners In the 40s | publisher=Geocities | url=http://www.geocities.com/ps971100/NYFCC40.htm | accessdate=5 March 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kmWxZj10|archivedate=25 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref> for her \"outstanding performance in ''Suspicion''\".

In the book the movie is based on (''[[Before the Fact]]'' by [[Francis Iles]]), the Grant character is a killer, but Hitchcock and the studio felt Grant's image would be tarnished by that ending. Though a homicide would have suited him better, as he stated to Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Hitchcock settled for an ambiguous finale.<ref>Thomas Leitch, ''The Encyclopedia of Alfred Hitchcock'', Facts on File, New York, pp. 324\u2013325, ISBN 978-0-8160-4386-6</ref>\n\n''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942) was the first of two films that Hitchcock made for [[Universal Studios|Universal]], a studio where he would continue his career during his later years.

That year he also directed ''Have You Heard?'', a photographic dramatisation of the [[Loose lips sink ships|dangers of rumours during wartime]], for ''Life'' magazine.<ref name=\"life1942071368\">{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3E0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA21&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=\"Have You Heard?\": The Story of Wartime Rumors | work=Life | date=13 July 1942 | accessdate=17 November 2011 | pages=68\u201373}}</ref>\n\n''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), Hitchcock's personal favourite of all his films and the second of the early Universal films,<ref>In an interview on the Dick Cavett show aired on 8 June 1972, when asked if he had a personal favourite, Hitchcock responded that it was ''Shadow of a Doubt''.</ref> was about young Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton ([[Teresa Wright]]), who suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Oakley ([[Joseph Cotten]]) of being a serial murderer. Critics have said that in its use of overlapping characters, dialogue, and closeups it has provided a generation of film theorists with psychoanalytic potential{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, including [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]]. Hitchcock again filmed extensively on location, this time in the Northern California city of [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], during the summer of 1942. The director showcased his own personal fascination with crime and criminals when he had two of his characters discuss various ways of killing people, to the obvious annoyance of Charlotte.\n\nWorking at [[20th Century Fox]], Hitchcock adapted a script of [[John Steinbeck]]'s that chronicled the experiences of the survivors of a German U-boat attack in the film ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale also posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance. That was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that [[William Bendix]] is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for \"Reduco-Obesity Slayer\".<ref>Leitch, p. 181</ref>\n\nWhile at Fox, Hitchcock seriously considered directing the film version of [[A. J. Cronin]]'s novel about a Catholic priest in China,<ref name=\"Patrick McGilligan, p. 343\">Patrick McGilligan, p. 343</ref> ''[[The Keys of the Kingdom (film)|The Keys of the Kingdom]]'', but the plans for this fell through. [[John M. Stahl]] ended up directing the 1944 film, which was produced by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] and starred [[Gregory Peck]], among other luminaries.<ref name=\"Patrick McGilligan, p. 343\"/>\n\nReturning to England for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944, Hitchcock made two short films for the Ministry of Information, ''[[Bon Voyage (1944 film)|Bon Voyage]]'' and ''[[Aventure malgache]]''. Made for the [[Free French]], these were the only films Hitchcock made in the French language, and \"feature typical Hitchcockian touches\".<ref>Patrick McGilligan, pp. 346\u2013348</ref> In the 1990s, the two films were shown by [[Turner Classic Movies]] and released on home video.\n\nIn 1945, Hitchcock served as \"treatment advisor\" (in effect, a [[film editor]]) for a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] documentary produced by the British Army. The film, which recorded the liberation of [[Nazi concentration camps]], remained unreleased until 1985, when it was completed by [[PBS Frontline]] and distributed under the title ''Memory of the Camps''.<ref>Patrick McGilligan, pp. 372\u2013374</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Memory of the Camps |url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp |work=FRONTLINE |publisher=Public Broadcasting System (PBS) |accessdate=7 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock worked for Selznick again when he directed ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), which explored [[psychoanalysis]]<ref>{{cite web |last= Boyd |first= David |title= The Parted Eye: ''Spellbound'' and Psychoanalysis |url= http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/6/spellbound.html |year= 2000}}</ref> and featured a dream sequence designed by [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]. [[Gregory Peck]] plays amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes under the treatment of analyst Dr. Peterson ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), who falls in love with him while trying to unlock his repressed past.<ref>Leitch, p. 310</ref> The dream sequence as it actually appears in the film is considerably shorter than was originally envisioned, which was to be several minutes long,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} because it proved to be too disturbing for the audience. Two point-of-view shots were achieved by constructing a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and out-sized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-coloured red on (some copies of) the black-and-white film.\nSome of the original musical score by [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa]] (which makes use of the [[theremin]]) was later adapted by the composer into a concert piano concerto. \n\n[[Image:Notorious1946.jpg|left|thumb|Grant and Bergman in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946)]]\n''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946) followed ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''. According to Hitchcock, in his book-length interview with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Selznick sold the director, the two stars (Grant and Bergman) and the screenplay (by Ben Hecht) to RKO Radio Pictures as a \"package\" for $500,000 due to cost overruns on Selznick's ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946). ''Notorious'' starred Hitchcock regulars Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant, and features a plot about Nazis, [[uranium]], and South America. It was a huge box office success and has remained one of Hitchcock's most acclaimed films{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. His use of uranium as a plot device led to Hitchcock's being briefly under FBI surveillance. McGilligan writes that Hitchcock consulted Dr. [[Robert Millikan]] of [[Caltech]] about the development of an atomic bomb. Selznick complained that the notion was \"science fiction\", only to be confronted by the news stories of the detonation of two atomic bombs on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in Japan in August 1945.<ref>Patrick McGilligan, pp. 366\u2013381</ref>\n\nAfter completing his final film for Selznick, ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (a courtroom drama that critics found lost momentum because it apparently ran too long and exhausted its resource of ideas), Hitchcock filmed his first colour film, ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948). Here Hitchcock experimented with marshaling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1943). Appearing to have been shot entirely in a single take, ''Rope'' (1948) was actually shot in 10 takes ranging from four and a half to 10&nbsp;minutes each; a 10-minute length of film being the maximum a camera's film magazine could hold at the time. Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place. Featuring [[James Stewart]] in the leading role, ''Rope'' was the first of four films Stewart would make with Hitchcock. It was based on the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case of the 1920s. Somehow Hitchcock's cameraman managed to move the bulky, heavy [[Technicolor]] camera quickly around the set as it followed the continuous action of the long takes.\n\n''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949), set in nineteenth-century Australia, also used the short-lived technique of long takes, but to a more limited extent. He again used Technicolor in this production, then returned to black-and-white films for several years. For ''Rope'' and ''Under Capricorn'', Hitchcock formed a production company with [[Sidney Bernstein]] called [[Transatlantic Pictures]], which became inactive after these two unsuccessful pictures. Hitchcock continued to produce his own films for the rest of his life.\n\n===1950s: Peak years===\n[[File:Rearwindow trailer 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Stewart]] and [[Grace Kelly]] in ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954)]]\n\nHitchcock filmed ''[[Stage Fright (film)|Stage Fright]]'' (1950) in the UK. For the first time, he matched one of [[Warner Bros.]]'<ref>{{cite web | title=Warner Bros. Studios | url=http://www2.warnerbros.com/main/homepage/homepage.html | accessdate=6 March 2008}}</ref> biggest stars, [[Jane Wyman]], with the sultry German actress [[Marlene Dietrich]]. Hitchcock used a number of prominent British actors, including [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]], [[Richard Todd]], and [[Alastair Sim]]. This was Hitchcock's first production for Warner Bros., which had distributed ''Rope'' and ''Under Capricorn'', because Transatlantic Pictures was experiencing financial difficulties.<ref>Patrick McGilligan, pp. 429, 774\u2013775</ref>\n\nWith the film ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951), based on the novel by [[Patricia Highsmith]], Hitchcock combined many elements from his preceding films. He approached [[Dashiell Hammett]] to write the dialogue but [[Raymond Chandler]] took over, then left over disagreements with the director.<ref>Leitch, p. 320</ref> Two men casually meet, one of whom speculates on a foolproof murder technique. He suggests that two people, each wishing to do away with someone, should each perform the other's murder. [[Farley Granger]]'s role was as the innocent victim of the scheme, while  [[Robert Walker (actor)|Robert Walker]], previously known for \"boy-next-door\" roles, played the villain.<ref>Leitch, p.322</ref>\n\n[[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] head [[Lew Wasserman]], whose client list included [[James Stewart]], [[Janet Leigh]] and other actors who would appear in Hitchcock's films, had a significant impact in packaging and marketing Hitchcock's films beginning in the 1950s.\n\nAfter ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' (1953) with [[Montgomery Clift]], three popular films starring [[Grace Kelly]] followed. ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954) was adapted from the stage play by [[Frederick Knott]]. [[Ray Milland]] plays the scheming villain, an ex-tennis pro who tries to murder his unfaithful wife [[Grace Kelly]] for her money. When she kills the hired assassin in self-defense, Milland manipulates the evidence to pin the death on his wife. Her lover, Mark Halliday ([[Robert Cummings]]), and Police Inspector Hubbard ([[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]]), work urgently to save her from execution.<ref>Leitch, pp. 78\u201380</ref> Hitchcock experimented with [[3-D film|3D]] cinematography. The depth effect was utilised in a major way only in one key scene. The public was growing weary of 3D by the time of the film's release, however, and it was shown in 3D only in a few first-run engagements. The 3D version has been revived from time to time, including a brief reissue in some major US cities in the 1980s. The film marked a return to color productions for Hitchcock.\n\nHitchcock then moved to [[Paramount Pictures]] and filmed ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), starring James Stewart and Kelly again, as well as [[Thelma Ritter]] and [[Raymond Burr]]. Stewart's character, a photographer based on [[Robert Capa]], must temporarily use a wheelchair; out of boredom he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard, and becomes convinced one of them (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. Stewart tries to sway both his glamorous model-girlfriend (Kelly), whom screenwriter [[John Michael Hayes]] based on his own wife, and his policeman buddy ([[Wendell Corey]]) to his theory, and eventually succeeds.<ref name=\"Leitch1\">Leitch, p. 269</ref> As with ''Lifeboat'' and ''Rope'', the principal characters were almost entirely confined to a small space, in this case Stewart's tiny studio apartment overlooking a massive courtyard. Hitchcock used closeups of Stewart's face to show his character's reactions to all he sees, \"from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbours to his helpless terror watching Kelly and Burr in the villain's apartment\".<ref name=\"Leitch1\"/>\n\nThe third Kelly film, ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), set in the French Riviera, paired her with Cary Grant. He plays retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera. An American heiress played by Kelly surmises his true identity, attempts to seduce him. \"Despite the obvious age disparity between Grant and Kelly and a lightweight plot, the witty script (loaded with double-entendres) and the good-natured acting proved a commercial success.\"<ref>Leitch, p. 366</ref> It was Hitchcock's last film with Kelly. She married [[Prince Rainier]] of [[Monaco]] in 1956, and the residents of her new land were against her making any more films.\n\nHitchcock successfully remade his own 1934 film ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' in 1956, this time starring Stewart and [[Doris Day]], who sang the theme song,  \"[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)]]\", which won the Oscar for Best Original Song and became a big hit for her. They play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination. As in the 1934 film, the climax takes place at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], London.<ref>Royal S. Brown (1994). \"Overtones and Undertones: Reading Film Music\". p. 75.

This was the only film of Hitchcock's to star [[Henry Fonda]]. Fonda plays a Stork Club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife (newcomer [[Vera Miles]]) emotionally collapses under the strain. Hitchcock told Truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes.<ref>Leitch, p. 377</ref>\n\n''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) again starred Stewart, this time with [[Kim Novak]] and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]]. Stewart plays \"Scottie\", a former police investigator suffering from [[acrophobia]], who develops an obsession with a woman he is shadowing (Novak). Scottie's obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Hitchcock does not opt for a happy ending. The film contains a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts that has been copied many times by filmmakers, wherein the image appears to \"stretch\". This is achieved by moving the camera in the opposite direction of the camera's zoom. It has become known by many nicknames, including [[Dolly zoom]], \"Zolly,\" \"Hitchcock Zoom,\" and \"Vertigo Effect.\"\n\nAlthough the film is widely considered a classic today, ''Vertigo'' met with negative reviews and poor box office receipts upon its release, and was the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock.<ref>Leitch, pp. 376\u2013377</ref> Although ranked second (behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'') for almost 50 years the film was voted top by critics in the 2012 ''[[Sight and Sound|Sight & Sound]]'' decade poll.

The third film was ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).\n\nIn ''North by Northwest'', Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent.<ref>Leitch, p. 234</ref> He is hotly pursued by enemy agents across America, apparently one of them being Eve Kendall ([[Eva Marie Saint]]), in fact working undercover.\n\n===From 1960===\n''Psycho'' is almost certainly Hitchcock's best-known film.<ref>Leitch, p. 260</ref> Produced on a highly constrained budget of $800,000, it was shot in black-and-white on a spare set.<ref>Leitch, p. 261</ref> The unprecedented violence of the shower scene, the early demise of the heroine, the innocent lives extinguished by a disturbed murderer were all hallmarks of Hitchcock, copied in many subsequent horror films.<ref>Leitch, p. 262</ref> After completing ''Psycho'', Hitchcock moved to Universal, where he made the remainder of his films.\n\n''The Birds'', inspired by a [[Daphne du Maurier]] short story and by an actual news story about a mysterious infestation of birds in California, was Hitchcock's 49th film.<ref>Leitch, p. 32</ref> He signed up [[Tippi Hedren]] as his latest blonde heroine opposite [[Rod Taylor]]. The scenes of the birds attacking included hundreds of shots mixing actual and animated sequences. The cause of the birds' attack is left unanswered, \"perhaps highlighting the mystery of forces unknown\".<ref>Leitch, p. 33</ref> Hedren later called Hitchcock a misogynist and said that Hitchcock effectively ended her career by trapping her in her contract when she rebuffed his sexual advances.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/magazine/the-revenge-of-tippi-hedren-alfred-hitchcocks-muse.html?ref=magazine</ref> In 2012, Hedren described Hitchcock as a \"sad character\"; a man of \"unusual genius\", yet \"evil, and deviant, almost to the point of dangerous, because of the effect that he could have on people that were totally unsuspecting.\"<ref name=Crum_08_02_2012>{{cite web |last=Crum |first=Amanda |title=Tippi Hedren: Alfred Hitchcock Was \"Evil\" And \"Dangerous\" |url=http://www.webpronews.com/tippi-hedren-alfred-hitchcock-was-evil-and-dangerous-2012-08 |date=2 October 2012|accessdate=24 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe latter two films had unconventional soundtracks, both orchestrated by [[Bernard Herrmann]]: the screeching strings played in the murder scene in ''Psycho'' were unusually dissonant, and ''The Birds'' dispensed completely with conventional instruments, instead using an electronically produced soundtrack and an unaccompanied song by schoolchildren (just prior to the attack at the Bodega Bay School). These films are considered his last great films, after which critical opinion was usually against his new films, although some critics, such as [[Robin Wood (film critic)|Robin Wood]] and [[Donald Spoto]], contend that ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964) is first-class Hitchcock, and some have argued that ''Frenzy'' is unfairly overlooked.\n\nFailing health took its toll on Hitchcock, reducing his output during the last two decades of his career. He filmed two spy thrillers set with [[Cold War]]-related themes. The first, ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966), with [[Paul Newman]] and [[Julie Andrews]], displays the bitter end of the twelve-year collaboration between Hitchcock and composer Bernard Herrmann. Herrmann was fired when Hitchcock was unsatisfied with his score. ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' (1969), (based on a [[Leon Uris]] novel), is partly set in Cuba. Both received mixed reviews from critics.\n[[File:Hitch-at-work;1975-FamilyPlot;SF-On-Location.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hitchcock at work on location in San Francisco for ''[[Family Plot]]'']]\nIn 1972, Hitchcock returned to England to film his penultimate film ''[[Frenzy]]''. After two only moderately successful espionage films, the plot marks a return to the murder thriller genre of earlier in his career, and is based upon the novel ''[[Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square]]''. The plot centers on a serial killer in contemporary London. In a very early scene there is dialogue that mentions two actual London serial murder cases: the [[John Christie (murderer)|Christie murders]] in the early 1950s, and the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders in 1888. The basic story recycles his early film ''The Lodger''. Richard Blaney ([[Jon Finch]]), a volatile barkeeper with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect for the \"Necktie Murders,\" which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk ([[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]]).<ref name=\"Leitch2\">Leitch, p. 114</ref> This time, Hitchcock makes the victim and villain twins, rather than opposites, as in ''Strangers on a Train''. Only one of them, however, has crossed the line to murder.<ref name=\"Leitch2\"/> For the first time, Hitchcock allowed nudity and profane language, which had before been taboo, in one of his films. He also shows rare sympathy for the chief inspector and his comic domestic life.<ref>Leitch, p. 115</ref> Biographers have noted that Hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool [[Joseph Breen]], the longtime head of Hollywood's [[Production Code]]. Many times Hitchcock slipped in subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet Patrick McGilligan wrote that Breen and others often realised that Hitchcock was inserting such things and were actually amused as well as alarmed by Hitchcock's \"inescapable inferences\".<ref>Patrick McGilligan, p. 249</ref> Beginning with ''Torn Curtain'', Hitchcock was finally able to blatantly include plot elements previously forbidden in American films and this continued for the remainder of his film career.\n\n''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976) was Hitchcock's last film. It relates the escapades of \"Madam\" Blanche Tyler, played by [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi driver lover [[Bruce Dern]], making a living from her phoney powers. [[William Devane]], [[Karen Black]] and [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] co-starred. It is the only Hitchcock film scored by [[John Williams]]. Based on the [[Victor Canning]] novel ''The Rainbird Pattern'', the novel's tone is more sinister and dark than what Hitchcock wanted for the film. Screenwriter [[Ernest Lehman]] originally wrote the film with a dark tone but was pushed to a lighter, more comical tone by Hitchcock. The film went through various titles including ''Deceit'' and ''Missing Heir''. It was changed to ''Family Plot'' at the suggestion of the studio.\n\n===Last project and death===\nNear the end of his life, Hitchcock had worked on the script for a projected spy thriller, ''[[The Short Night]]'', collaborating with screenwriters [[James Costigan]] and [[Ernest Lehman]]. Despite some preliminary work, the story was never filmed. This was due primarily to Hitchcock's own failing health and his concerns over the health of his wife, Alma, who had suffered a stroke. The script was eventually published posthumously, in a book on Hitchcock's last years.<ref>Patrick McGilligan, pp. 731\u2013734</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Freeman |first= David |title= The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock |year= 1999 |publisher=Overlook |isbn= 978-0-87951-728-1}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock died in his [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] home of [[renal failure]] at 9:17&nbsp;am on 29 April 1980.

Thus, the MacGuffin was always hazily described (in \"North By Northwest,\" Leo G. Carroll describes James Mason as an \"importer-exporter.\")\n\n==Signature appearances in his films==\n{{Main|List of Hitchcock cameo appearances}}\nHitchcock appeared briefly in most of his own films. For example, he is seen struggling to get a [[double bass]] onto a train (''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]''), or walking dogs out of a pet shop (''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''), as  a shadow (''[[Family Plot]]'') and sitting at a table in a photograph (''[[Dial M for Murder]]'').\n\n==Psychology of characters==\nHitchcock's films sometimes feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers. In ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]'s character) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963), the [[Rod Taylor]] character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself of a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' has a clearly conflictual relationship with his mother, who is (correctly) suspicious of his new bride Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]). Norman Bates has troubles with his mother in ''[[Psycho (film)|Psycho]]''.\n\nHitchcock heroines tend to be lovely, cool blondes who seem proper at first but, when aroused by passion or danger, respond in a more sensual, animal, or even criminal way. The famous victims in ''The Lodger'' are all blondes. In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', Hitchcock's glamorous blonde star, [[Madeleine Carroll]], is put in handcuffs. In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), the title character (played by [[Tippi Hedren]]) is a [[thief]]. In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), Francie ([[Grace Kelly]]) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Rear Window]]'', Lisa (Grace Kelly again) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. The best-known example is in ''Psycho'' where [[Janet Leigh]]'s unfortunate character steals $40,000 and is murdered by a reclusive psychopath. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was\u2014years after [[Dany Robin]] and her \"daughter\" [[Claude Jade]] in ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''\u2014[[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in his final film, 1976's ''[[Family Plot]]''. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] could also fit that role, as she wears a long blonde wig in various scenes and becomes increasingly uncomfortable about her line of work.\n\nSome critics and Hitchcock scholars, including Donald Spoto and [[Roger Ebert]], agree that ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' represents the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires. ''Vertigo'' explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other film in his filmography.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kehr|first=Dave|title=When Movies Mattered: Reviews from a Transformative Decade|year=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-42940-3|pages=259|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZGgPCODtVZsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> \n\nHitchcock often said that his favourite film (of his own work) was ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]''.<ref>[Dick Cavett Show interview, 8 June 1972]</ref>\n\n==Style of working==\n\n===Writing===\nHitchcock once commented, \"The writer and I plan out the entire script down to the smallest detail, and when we're finished all that's left to do is to shoot the film. Actually, it's only when one enters the studio that one enters the area of compromise. Really, the novelist has the best casting since he doesn't have to cope with the actors and all the rest.\" In an interview with Roger Ebert in 1969, Hitchcock elaborated further:\n{{quote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all... I have a strongly visual mind. I visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score... When you finish the script, the film is perfect. But in shooting it you lose perhaps 40 percent of your original conception.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19691214/PEOPLE/912140301/1023 |title=Hitchcock: \"Never mess about with a dead body \u2013 you may be one...\" |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=14 December 1969 |accessdate=26 July 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Writing with Hitchcock'', a book-length study of Hitchcock's working method with his writers, author Steven DeRosa noted that \"Although he rarely did any actual 'writing', especially on his Hollywood productions, Hitchcock supervised and guided his writers through every draft, insisting on a strict attention to detail and a preference for telling the story through visual rather than verbal means. While this exasperated some writers, others admitted the director inspired them to do their very best work. Hitchcock often emphasised that he took no screen credit for the writing of his films. However, over time the work of many of his writers has been attributed solely to Hitchcock\u2019s creative genius, a misconception he rarely went out of his way to correct. Notwithstanding his technical brilliance as a director, Hitchcock relied on his writers a great deal.\"<ref>Steven DeRosa, ''Writing with Hitchcock'', New York: Faber and Faber, 2001, p. xi.</ref>\n\n===Storyboards and production===\nHitchcock's films were strongly believed to have been extensively storyboarded to the finest detail by the majority of commentators over the years. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, though in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternate takes to consider.\n\nHowever, this view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by the book ''Hitchcock At Work'', written by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]''. Krohn, after investigating several script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock alongside inspection of storyboards, and other production material, has observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned. He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his movies, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. A great example would be the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' which was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.\n\nEven when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from it significantly. Krohn's extensive analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his movies, he was fully cognizant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions.\n\nKrohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternate takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how he/she chooses (often under the producer's aegis). Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency of giving himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nHis fastidiousness and attention to detail also found its way into each [[film poster]] for his films. Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his day\u2014film poster designers such as [[Bill Gold]] and [[Saul Bass]]\u2014and kept them busy with countless rounds of revision until he felt that the single image of the poster accurately represented his entire film.\n\n===Approach to actors===\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder.\"\n| source = \u2014Alfred Hitchcock\n| width  = 25em\n| align  = right\n}}\n\nSimilarly, much of Hitchcock's supposed dislike of actors has been exaggerated. Hitchcock simply did not tolerate the [[Method acting|method]] approach, as he believed that actors should only concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. In a ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' interview, he stated that, 'the method actor is OK in the theatre because he has a free space to move about. But when it comes to cutting the face and what he sees and so forth, there must be some discipline'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alfred Hitchcock| publisher=BFI (Because Films Inspire)| url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/hitchcock.html#actors | accessdate=4 March 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080210051052/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/hitchcock.html| archivedate= 10 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> During the making of ''Lifeboat'', [[Walter Slezak]], who played the German character, stated that Hitchcock knew the mechanics of acting better than anyone he knew. Several critics have observed that despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors, several actors who worked with him gave fine, often brilliant performances and these performances contribute to the film's success.\n\nFor Hitchcock, the actors, like the props, were part of the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut: \n\n<blockquote>In my opinion, the chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.<ref>Truffaut, Fran\u00e7ois. \"Hitchcock by Truffaut: The Definitive Study\". Grafton Books, 1984. p. 153</ref></blockquote>\n\nRegarding Hitchcock's sometimes less than pleasant relationship with actors, there was a persistent rumour that he had said that actors were cattle. Hitchcock addressed this story in his interview with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut:\n\n<blockquote>I'm not quite sure in what context I might have made such a statement. It may have been made...when we used actors who were simultaneously performing in stage plays. When they had a matinee, and I suspected they were allowing themselves plenty of time for a very leisurely lunch. And this meant that we had to shoot our scenes at breakneck speed so that the actors could get out on time. I couldn't help feeling that if they'd been really conscientious, they'd have swallowed their sandwich in the cab, on the way to the theatre, and get there in time to put on their make-up and go on stage. I had no use for that kind of actor.<ref name=\"Truffaut, Fran\u00e7ois 1984. p. 140\">Truffaut, Fran\u00e7ois. \"Hitchcock\". Simon & Schuster, 1984. p. 140</ref></blockquote>  \n\n[[Carole Lombard]], tweaking Hitchcock and drumming up a little publicity, brought some cows along with her when she reported to the set of ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. and Mrs. Smith]]''.<ref name=\"Truffaut, Fran\u00e7ois 1984. p. 140\"/> \n\nIn the late 1950s, [[French New Wave]] critics, especially [[\u00c9ric Rohmer]], [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], were among the first to see and promote Hitchcock's films as artistic works. Hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their [[auteur theory]], which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the film-making process.\n\nHitchcock's innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers, [[Film producer|producers]], and actors. His influence helped start a trend for film directors to control artistic aspects of their movies without answering to the movie's producer.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n{{Main|Alfred Hitchcock awards}}\nHitchcock was a multiple nominee and winner of a number of prestigious awards, receiving two [[Golden Globes]], eight [[Laurel Awards]] and five [[lifetime achievement awards]], as well as being five times nominated for, albeit never winning, an [[Academy Award]] as Best Director. His film ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (nominated for 11 Oscars) won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture#1940s|Academy Award for Best Picture of 1940]]\u2014particularly notable as another Hitchcock film, ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'', was also nominated that same year.<ref>[http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/13th-winners.html \"The 13th Academy Awards (1941) Nominees and Winners\"]. \u00a92012 Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref>\n\nIn addition to these, Hitchcock received a [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|knighthood]] in 1980 when he was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in the 1980 [[New Year Honours]].<ref>Adair, Gene. \"Alfred Hitchcock: Filming Our Fears\". p. 145.

From 1955 to 1965, Hitchcock was the host and producer of a television series titled ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''.<ref>{{cite web| title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents| publisher=TV.COM| url=http://www.tv.com/alfred-hitchcock-presents/show/238/summary.html | accessdate=5 March 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080125154314/http://www.tv.com/alfred-hitchcock-presents/show/238/summary.html?| archivedate= 25 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> While his films had made Hitchcock's name strongly associated with suspense, the TV series made Hitchcock a celebrity himself. His [[irony]]-tinged voice and signature droll delivery, gallows humour, iconic image and mannerisms became instantly recognisable and were often the subject of parody.\n\nThe title-theme of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of Hitchcock's profile (he drew it himself; it is composed of only nine strokes), which his real silhouette then filled. His introductions before the stories in his program always included some sort of wry humour, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one [[electric chair]], while two are now shown with a sign \"Two chairs\u2014no waiting!\" He directed a few episodes of the TV series himself, and he upset a number of movie production companies when he insisted on using his TV production crew to produce his motion picture ''Psycho''. In the late 1980s, a new version of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions in a [[Film colorization|colourised]] form.\n\nThe series used a curious little tune<ref>{{cite web| title =Alfred Hitchcock (suspense anthology)| publisher=Media Management Group|url =http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/alfredHitchcock.html| accessdate=4 March 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080221144330/http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/alfredHitchcock.html| archivedate= 21 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> by the French composer [[Charles Gounod]] (1818\u20131893),<ref>{{cite web| title =Filmography by year for Charles Gounod| publisher=Internet Movie Database| url =http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006111/filmoyear| accessdate =4 March 2008}}</ref> the composer of the 1859 opera ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', as the theme for his television programs, after it was suggested to him by composer Bernard Herrmann. [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] included the piece, ''Funeral March of a Marionette'', on one of their extended play 45-rpm discs for [[RCA Victor]] during the 1950s.\n\n''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' was parodied by [[Friz Freleng]]'s 1961 [[cartoon]] ''[[The Last Hungry Cat]]'', which contains a plot similar to ''Blackmail''.\n\nHitchcock appears as a character in the popular juvenile detective book series, ''[[Three Investigators|Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators]]''. The long-running detective series was created by [[Robert Arthur (writer)|Robert Arthur]], who wrote the first several books, although other authors took over after he left the series. The Three Investigators\u2014Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews and Peter Crenshaw\u2014were amateur detectives, slightly younger than the [[Hardy Boys]]. In the introduction to each book, \"Alfred Hitchcock\" introduces the mystery, and he sometimes refers a case to the boys to solve. At the end of each book, the boys report to Hitchcock, and sometimes give him a memento of their case.\n\nWhen the real Hitchcock died, the fictional Hitchcock in the ''Three Investigators'' books was replaced by a retired detective named Hector Sebastian. At this time, the series title was changed from ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators'' to ''The Three Investigators''.\n\nAt the height of Hitchcock's success, he was also asked to introduce a set of books with his name attached. The series was a collection of short stories by popular short-story writers, primarily focused on suspense and thrillers. These titles included ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Anthology]]'', ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories to be Read with the Door Locked'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Monster Museum'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Supernatural Tales of Terror and Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbinders in Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Witch's Brew'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Ghostly Gallery'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's A Hangman's Dozen'' and ''Alfred Hitchcock's Haunted Houseful.'' Hitchcock himself was not actually involved in the reading, reviewing, editing or selection of the short stories; in fact, even his introductions were ghost-written. The entire extent of his involvement with the project was to lend his name and collect a check.\n\nSome notable writers whose works were used in the collection include [[Shirley Jackson]] (''Strangers in Town'', ''[[The Lottery]]''), [[T.H. White]] (''[[The Once and Future King]]''), [[Robert Bloch]], [[H. G. Wells]] (''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]''), [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Mark Twain]] and the creator of ''[[The Three Investigators]]'', [[Robert Arthur (writer)|Robert Arthur]].\n\nIn a similar manner, Hitchcock's name was licensed for a digest-sized monthly, ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]'', which has been published since 1956.\n\nHitchcock also wrote a mystery story for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine in 1943, \"The Murder of [[Monty Woolley]]\". This was a sequence of captioned photographs inviting the reader to inspect the pictures for clues to the murderer's identity; Hitchcock cast the performers as themselves, such as Woolley, Doris Merrick and make-up man Guy Pearce, whom Hitchcock identified, in the last photo, as the murderer. The article was reprinted in ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' Magazine in November/December 1980.\n\nIn September 2010, [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC Radio 7]] broadcast a series of five fifteen-minute programs entitled ''The Late Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' with [[Michael Roberts (actor)|Michael Roberts]] impersonating Alfred Hitchcock for introductory/concluding comments and reading the stories in his own voice.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tqlfh \"The Late Alfred Hitchcock Presents\"].

The first known use of the term \"astronaut\" in the modern sense was by [[Neil R. Jones]] in his short story \"The Death's Head Meteor\" in 1930. The word itself had been known earlier. For example, in [[Percy Greg]]'s 1880 book ''Across the Zodiac'', \"astronaut\" referred to a spacecraft. In ''Les Navigateurs de l'Infini'' (1925) of [[J.-H. Rosny a\u00een\u00e9]], the word ''astronautique'' (astronautic) was used. The word may have been inspired by \"aeronaut\", an older term for an air traveler first applied (in 1784) to [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]ists. An early use in a non-fiction publication is [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s poem \"The Astronaut\" in the November 1934 ''Bulletin of the [[British Interplanetary Society]]''.<ref>Ingham, John L.: ''Into Your Tent'', Plantech (2010): page 82.</ref>\n\nThe first known formal use of the term [[astronautics]] in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual [[International Astronautical Congress]] in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the [[International Astronautical Federation]] the following year.<ref name=\"IAFpage\">{{cite web | last = |first = | title = IAF History | publisher = [[International Astronautical Federation]] |author=IAF |date = 2010-08-16| url = http://www.iafastro.org/index.html?title=History| accessdate = 2010-08-16 }}</ref>\n\n[[NASA]] applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard NASA spacecraft bound for Earth orbit or beyond.

A variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the National Space and Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) to address these issues. Prominent among these is the [[Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity]] Study in which astronauts (including former ISS commanders [[Leroy Chiao]] and [[Gennady Padalka]]) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space. This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in medical and high school students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html NASA - Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>A Pilot Study of Comprehensive Ultrasound Education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine: http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/5/745</ref><ref>Evaluation of Shoulder Integrity in Space: First Report of Musculoskeletal US on the International Space Station: http://radiology.rsna.org/content/234/2/319.abstract</ref>\n\n==Insignia==\nIn Russia, cosmonauts are awarded [[Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation]] upon completion of their missions, often accompanied with the award of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]].  This follows the practice established in the Soviet Union.\n\nAt NASA, those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver [[Astronaut Badge#NASA Astronaut Pins|lapel pin]]. Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold pin. U.S. astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a special qualification badge, known as the [[Astronaut Badge]], after participation on a spaceflight. The [[United States Air Force]] also presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed {{convert|50|mi|km}} in altitude.\n\n[[File:amf space mirror.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Space Mirror Memorial]]\n\n==Deaths==\n{{Main|List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents#Astronaut fatalities}}\n\nEighteen astronauts (fourteen men and four women) have lost their lives during four space flights.

Six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft, one drowned during water recovery training, and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments. \n\nThe [[Space Mirror Memorial]], which stands on the grounds of the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] Visitor Complex, commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the United States. In addition to twenty NASA career astronauts, the memorial includes the names of a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[X-15]] test pilot, a U.S. Air Force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program, and a civilian [[spaceflight participant]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight|Space|Solar System|Astronomy}}\n\n{{Div col}}\n* [[United States Astronaut Hall of Fame]]\n* [[Commercial Astronaut]]\n* [[List of astronauts by name]]\n* [[List of astronauts by selection]]\n* [[Timeline of astronauts by nationality]]\n* [[List of cosmonauts]]\n* [[List of human spaceflights]]\n* [[List of space travelers by name]]\n* [[List of space travelers by nationality]]\n* [[List of spacewalks and moonwalks]]\n* [[List of married couples among space travelers]]\n* [[North American X-15]] program\n* [[Space food]]\n* [[Spaceflight records]]\n* [[Space Suit]]s\n* [[Shirley Thomas (USC professor)|Shirley Thomas]], author of ''Men of Space'' series (1960\u20131968)\n* [[Russian cosmonauts]]\n* [[Cosmonautics Day]]\n* [[Yuri's Night]]\n* [[Outer_space#Boundary|Boundary of Space]]\n* [[Fallen Astronaut]]\n* [[List of fictional astronauts]]\n* [[Mercury 13]], a group of 13 women who were tested, but never flew in space\n* [[J-Wear]]\n* [[U.S. space exploration history on U.S. stamps]]\n* [[Participation in Space travel]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|cosmonaut|spationaut|astronaut|taikonaut}}\n{{Commons category|Astronauts}}\n* [http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/outreach/jobsinfo/astronaut101.html NASA: How to become an astronaut 101]\n* [http://astronauts.nasa.gov/content/InternationalSpaceAgencies.htm List of International partnership organizations]\n* [http://www.astronautix.com/astrogrp/phaonaut.htm Encyclopedia Astronautica: Phantom cosmonauts]\n* [http://www.collectspace.com/sightings/ collectSPACE: Astronaut appearances calendar]\n* [http://www.spacefacts.de/ spacefacts Spacefacts.de]\n* [http://space.kursknet.ru/cosmos/english/other/stat_kk.sht Manned astronautics: facts and figures]\n* [http://astronauts.nasa.gov/content/broch00.htm Astronaut Candidate Brochure online]\n* [http://ps3missionaccomplished.com/show/neil+armstrong+death Tribute to Astronaut Neil Armstrong -

([[veterinary medicine|Veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)\n\n==Agriculture and agricultural science==\n\nThe two terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:\n*[[Agriculture]] is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.\n*[[Agronomy]] is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based agriculture.\n\nAgricultural sciences include research and development on:\n* Production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs)\n* Improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)\n* Transformation of primary products into end-[[consumer]] products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)\n* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]])\n* [[Theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling\n* Traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed [[subsistence agriculture]], which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of [[industrial agriculture]], which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems.\n* Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil the USA and the EU.\n\n== Fertilizer ==\nOne of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period, the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter.  Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue, which can take a few months to several years to decompose, depending on the crop's C to N ratio and the local environment\n\n==Agricultural science: a local science==\n\nWith the exception of [[theoretical production ecology|theoretical agronomy]], research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of [[ecoregions]], because it is closely linked to soil properties and [[climate]], which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, [[soil]] characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.\n\n==History of agricultural science==\n{{Main|History of agricultural science}}\n\nAgricultural science began with [[Gregor Mendel]]'s genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the [[chemical fertilizer]] outputs of [[plant physiology|plant physiological]] understanding in eighteenth century [[Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] of 1887, which used the term \"agricultural science\". The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.<ref>Hillison J. (1996).

''Journal of Agricultural Education''.</ref> After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.<ref name=ScienceForAg>Huffman WE, Evenson RE. (2006). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWcolrGftT0C Science for Agriculture]''. [[Blackwell Publishing]].</ref>{{rp|xxi}}\n\nIntensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in  selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide|phytosanitary product]]s.\n\nAs the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact  of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields  that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.\n\nNew technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[Religion and Agriculture|religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.\n\n===Prominent agricultural scientists===\n[[File:Norman Borlaug.jpg|thumb|200px|Norman Borlaug, father of the [[Green Revolution]].]]\n* [[Justus von Liebig]]\n* [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]]\n* [[Robert Bakewell (farmer)|Robert Bakewell]]\n* [[Norman Borlaug]]\n* [[Luther Burbank]]\n* [[George Washington Carver]]\n\n* [[Jay Lush]]\n* [[Gregor Mendel]]\n* [[Kailas Nath Kaul]]\n* [[Louis Pasteur]]\n* [[Eli Whitney, Jr.|Eli Whitney]]\n* [[Sewall Wright]]\n\n==Agricultural science and agriculture crisis==\nAgriculture sciences seek to feed the world's population while preventing [[biosafety]] problems that may affect human health and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. This requires promoting good management of [[natural resources]] and respect for the environment, and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system.\n\nEconomic, environmental, and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate. Recent crises (such as avian influenza, [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] and issues such as the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate.\n\n==Fields or related disciplines==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Agricultural diversification]]\n* [[Agricultural economics]]\n* [[Agricultural engineering]]\n* [[Agricultural geography]]\n* [[Agricultural philosophy]]\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[Agrophysics]]\n* [[Animal science]]\n** [[Animal breeding]]\n** [[Animal nutrition]]\n* [[Agronomy]]\n** [[Plant science]]\n** [[Theoretical production ecology]]\n** [[Horticulture]]\n** [[Plant breeding]]\n** [[fertilizer|Plant fertilization]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Aquaculture]]\n* [[Biological engineering]]\n** [[Genetic engineering]]\n** [[Microbiology]]\n* [[Environmental science]]\n* [[Food science]]\n** [[Human nutrition]]\n* [[Irrigation]] and [[water management]]\n* [[Soil science]]\n** [[Agrology]]\n* [[Waste management]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Agriculture ministry]]\n*[[Agricultural sciences basic topics]]\n*[[Agroecology]]\n*[[American Society of Agronomy]]\n*[[Genomics of domestication]]\n*[[List of agriculture topics]]\n*[[History of agricultural science]]\n*[[Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences]]\n*[[International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development]]\n*[[International Food Policy Research Institute]], [[IFPRI]]\n*[[Research Institute of Crop Production]] (RICP) (in the Czech Republic)\n*[[University of Agricultural Sciences]]\n*[[National FFA Organization]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title_pages/9358.html Agricultural Research, Livelihoods, and Poverty: Studies of Economic and Social Impacts in Six Countries] Edited by Michelle Adato and Ruth Meinzen-Dick (2007), Johns Hopkins University Press  Food Policy Report<ref name=\"Brief\">[http://www.ifpri.org/publication/agricultural-research-livelihoods-and-poverty Agricultural research, livelihoods, and poverty | International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Claude Bourguignon, ''Regenerating the Soil: From Agronomy to Agrology'', Other India Press, 2005\n*Pimentel David, Pimentel Marcia, ''Computer les kilocalories'', C\u00e9r\u00e8s, n. 59, sept-oct. 1977\n*Russell E.

In 2012, it is the parallel of [[latitude]] that runs {{Circle of latitude|Polar|Convert}} <ref>[http://www.neoprogrammics.com/obliquity_of_the_ecliptic/ ''obliquity of the ecliptic (Eps Mean)'']</ref> north of the [[Equator]].\n\nThe region north of this circle is known as the [[Arctic]], and the zone just to the south is called the [[Temperateness|Northern Temperate Zone]]. The equivalent [[polar circle]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] is called the [[Antarctic Circle]].\n\nThe Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for 24 hours (at the June solstice and December solstice respectively).  North of the Arctic Circle, the [[sun]] is above the [[horizon]] for 24 continuous [[hour]]s at least once per [[year]] (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year. On the Arctic Circle those events occur, in principle, exactly once per year, at the June and December [[solstice]]s, respectively.\n\nIt would therefore seem that the Arctic Circle marks the southern extremity of the northern hemisphere [[midnight sun|polar day]] (24-hour sunlit day, often referred to as the [[midnight sun]]) and [[polar night]] (24-hour sunless night).  In fact, because of [[atmospheric refraction]], [[mirage]]s and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the [[summer solstice|northern summer solstice]] up to about 50[[Minute|\u2032]] ({{convert|90|km|abbr=on}}) south of the Arctic Circle; similarly, on the day of the [[winter solstice|northern winter solstice]], part of the sun may be seen up to about 50\u2032 north of the Arctic Circle. That is true at sea level; those limits increase with elevation above sea level although in mountainous regions, there is often no direct view of the true horizon.\n\nThe position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed, but directly depends on the Earth's [[axial tilt]], which fluctuates within a margin of 2\u00b0 over a 40,000 year period,<ref>[http://www.communique.se/polcirkel/arctic.html Arctic Circle]</ref> notably due to [[tidal force]]s resulting from the [[orbit of the Moon]]. The Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} per year; see [[circle of latitude#Movement of the Tropical and Polar circles|''Circle of latitude'']] for more information.\n\n__TOC__<br clear=right>\n\n==Geography==\n{{GeoGroupTemplate}}\nRelatively few people live north of the Arctic Circle due to the [[Climate of the Arctic|Arctic climate]]. The three largest communities above the Arctic Circle are situated in Russia: [[Murmansk]] (population 307,257), [[Norilsk]] (175,301), and [[Vorkuta]] (70,548). [[Troms\u00f8]] (in Norway) has about 69,000 inhabitants and [[Bod\u00f8]] (47,847). In contrast, the largest North American community north of the circle, [[Sisimiut]] (Greenland), has approximately 5,000 inhabitants, while between Canada and the USA, [[Barrow, Alaska]] is the largest settlement with circa 4,000 inhabitants. [[Rovaniemi]] (in Finland), which lies slightly south of the line, has a population of approximately 60,000, and is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the Arctic Circle.  Among the people of the Arctic, the Norwegians have the easiest climate, with most ports in North Norway remaining ice-free all the year as a result of the [[Gulf Stream]]. \n\nThe Arctic Circle passes through the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], [[North Asia]], [[Northern America]] and [[Greenland]]. The land on the Arctic Circle is divided among eight countries: [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Russia]], the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Canada]], [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]]), and [[Iceland]] (where it passes through the small offshore island of [[Gr\u00edmsey]]).\n\nStarting at the [[Prime Meridian]] and heading eastwards, the Arctic Circle passes through:\n\n{| cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0\n|- valign=top\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
